# Login Functionality Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified:

1. **Missing body-parser dependency**: The app.js was trying to use `body-parser` which wasn't installed
2. **Incomplete Agent model**: Missing module.exports
3. **Server not running**: Need to start the backend server
4. **Database connection**: Need to ensure MongoDB is running

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Fixed app.js to use built-in express.json()
- Replaced `bodyParser.json()` with `express.json()`
- Removed dependency on body-parser

### 2. Fixed Agent.js model
- Added proper module.exports

### 3. Created test script for login logic
- `testLoginLogic.js` to test database and password validation

## To Start the Server and Test Login:

1. **Start MongoDB** (if not running):
   ```bash
   # Windows - if MongoDB is installed as service
   net start MongoDB
   
   # Or start mongod manually
   mongod --dbpath "C:\data\db"
   ```

2. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\hackton\automated-ticket-dispatcher\ticket-distribution-backend
   node src/app.js
   ```

3. **Test the login**:
   ```bash
   node src/debugLogin.js
   ```

## Login Endpoint Status:

The login route in `auth.js` looks correct and includes:
- ✅ Input validation (email and password required)
- ✅ User lookup by email
- ✅ Password comparison with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token generation
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

## Common Login Issues:

1. **400 Bad Request**: Usually means missing or invalid input data
2. **User not found**: No user with that email exists
3. **Invalid password**: Password doesn't match the hashed version
4. **Server not running**: Backend server needs to be started
5. **Database connection**: MongoDB needs to be running and accessible

## Test Users to Create:

The system expects these test users:
- customer@company.com (password: customer123, role: customer)
- agent@company.com (password: agent123, role: agent)
- admin@company.com (password: admin123, role: admin)

Run `createQuickUsers.js` to create these test users.
